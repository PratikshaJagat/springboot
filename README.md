this project is for booking airline tickets.
here the user can book ,cancel the booked tickets ,book multiple tickets,there is also a facility for login and authorization.
The API provides the details of flights ie ,the charges ,source and destination departure and arrival time etc.
you must create a database for this.
here I have used microservices, Eureka server,and to maintain the efficiency load balancer is used.
